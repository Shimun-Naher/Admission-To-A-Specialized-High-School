# Admission-To-A-Specialized-High-School
In this final project, I will explore a dataset provided by the New York City Department of
Education. Of particular interest is whether characteristics of NYC middle schools predict
admission to one of 8 highly selective public high schools (Stuyvesant, Bronx High School of
Science, etc.) in New York (from now on called HSPHS). Admission to these schools is contingent
on applying AND scoring sufficiently highly on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test
(SHSAT), an independently produced and anonymously graded standardized test.
